    "As the world's largest and most populated metropolis, Tokyo has a lot to offer in a myriad number of ways. One of the most exciting aspects is the dining experience. Tokyo features a full spectrum of both local and regional Japanese cuisine in addition to all types of international fare. From cheap hole-in-the-wall joints in the alleyways to expensive high-class restaurants on Roppongi Hills, delicious food can be found in every corner of the city with virtually every budget in between.\n",

    "**Business problem**: A fictitious start-up tour company called _**2 Rice 1 Sake**_ plans to sharpen its food guide in order to attract young and older foreign tourists who want to go on a fun food escapade in and around Tokyo. The firm was recently established and has few contacts on the ground. _**2 Rice 1 Sake**_ has requested an initial exploratory study on Tokyo's different wards and their features so that it can choose where to focus their food tours in in the later stages of project formulation. Specifically, the client wants  to obtain a broad picture of the kinds of restaurants that are popular and most frequented in different neighborhoods. The client is not interested in other recreational venues like parks, game centers, or sports facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fulfill the client's demands, I will use **Foursquare location data** and **K-Means clustering methods** to group Tokyo's 23 districts into their categories based on their restaurant venues information. To provide an additional depth to the picture that would be beneficial for our client's planning, I will also conduct a secondary analysis that uses data on **celebrity visits to Tokyo** in order to group the districts into categories based on the restaurant venues where prominent celebrities such as Tyler the Creator and Anthony Bourdain have dined out."
